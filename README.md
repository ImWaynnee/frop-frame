# FROPP (Free Options)

FROPP is a game within a frame encouraging engagement through prediction of BTC prices (options).

The whole flow is simplified so users just need to predict if the asset will be bullish/bearish, and having winning positions will give you $DEGEN tokens as a reward.

Since its free, the user initially needs to pass a 'luck' check, otherwise he has to wait for the next day to try.

Each user should only have 1 free attempt per event.
